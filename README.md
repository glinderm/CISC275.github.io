## Geoff Linderman's CISC275 Portfolio

Check out my reposity at: [Link]https://github.com/glinderm/CISC275.github.io

I'm new to Pages (and a bit shaky with Github!) so I'm keeping the tutorial below for my reference as I get a handle on this.

My short-term plan for the portfolio is to jump into Javascript and HTML. A couple years back I did the Codecademy Javascript tutorial ([Link]https://www.codecademy.com/catalog/language/javascript), but I haven't used it much since - hopefully I can get back into the swing of it quickly and start creating.

I haven't worked too much with HTML, but from what I have done it seems like a fairly simple, intuitive system with a lot of application, so I think it will be a good place to start as a backbone for my projects.

Looking forward to a great semester!

## Welcome!

You can use the [editor on GitHub](https://github.com/glinderm/CISC275.github.io/edit/main/README.md) to maintain and preview the content for your website in Markdown files.

Whenever you commit to this repository, GitHub Pages will run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the pages in your site, from the content in your Markdown files.

### Markdown

For more details see [GitHub Flavored Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/).

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/glinderm/CISC275.github.io/settings/pages). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
