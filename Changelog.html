                    <p>I may have been too ambitious in my last TODO - specifically, I had trouble both building a game in Javascript and implementing a visual interface for it. Going forward, I'll plan to continue working on this project.</p>
                    <p>I found CSS layout (and Bootstrap) simple in concept, but complicated and a bit frustrating when applied to an entire page (or more). I'd hoped to set up a simple but clean layout for my page, but I've had to settle for smaller improvements. Likely, I tried to do too much at once, and should instead work on a plan for specific items.</p>

                    <h3>Notes</h3>
                    <p>If my work looks frontloaded this milestone, see below. My presentable "products" came late, but I worked (struggled) consistently.</p>
                    <p>This milestone was the most challenging (or frustrating) for me. I worked consistently, but didn't find much to show for it. My blackjack page and game in particular were a huge struggle without much clear payoff, due to various factors. I do feel I learned a lot through my mistakes - javascript functions that were being called before they were declared and couldn't be hoisted because I had stored them in a variable, for instance. The trial and error gave me constant headaches, but if there's a silver lining, I know I won't make the same mistakes again.</p>
                    <p>Maybe the best example of this is my Bootstrap carousel and layout (and, later, these collapsible menus!). I struggled for 2 weeks on a carousel of pictures that wouldn't move, double and triple-checking my code. Everything looked correct. It was only on Thursday night that, at a glance, I noticed I was using Bootstrap v4.2., and the newest version was v5.1. I didn't think this would make a difference, but out of desperation and frustration, I revamped all my bootstrap source imports and formatting. Suddenly, everything worked perfectly. I wish I'd done that a week ago.</p>
                    <p>Ironically, in finally fixing these items, I broke others. The various tweaks and compromises I'd made to try and 'fix' my layout, which wasn't looking the way I thought it should despite my formatting, were suddenly creating a mess because they had been compensating for elements that weren't functioning properly. As I write this, I'm attempting to clean some of it up, but I apologize if the page is messy.</p>
