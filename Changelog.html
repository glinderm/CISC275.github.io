                    <p>I may have been too ambitious in my last TODO - specifically, I had trouble both building a game in Javascript and implementing a visual interface for it. Going forward, I'll plan to continue working on this project.</p>
                    <p>I found CSS layout (and Bootstrap) simple in concept, but complicated and a bit frustrating when applied to an entire page (or more). I'd hoped to set up a simple but clean layout for my page, but I've had to settle for smaller improvements. Likely, I tried to do too much at once, and should instead work on a plan for specific items.</p>

                    <h3>Notes</h3>
                    <p>If my work looks frontloaded this milestone, see below. My presentable "products" came late, but I worked (struggled) consistently.</p>
                    <p>This milestone was the most challenging (or frustrating) for me. I worked consistently, but didn't find much to show for it. My blackjack page and game in particular were a huge struggle without much clear payoff, due to various factors. I do feel I learned a lot through my mistakes - javascript functions that were being called before they were declared and couldn't be hoisted because I had stored them in a variable, for instance. The trial and error gave me constant headaches, but if there's a silver lining, I know I won't make the same mistakes again.</p>
                    <p>Maybe the best example of this is my Bootstrap carousel and layout (and, later, these collapsible menus!). I struggled for 2 weeks on a carousel of pictures that wouldn't move, double and triple-checking my code. Everything looked correct. It was only on Thursday night that, at a glance, I noticed I was using Bootstrap v4.2., and the newest version was v5.1. I didn't think this would make a difference, but out of desperation and frustration, I revamped all my bootstrap source imports and formatting. Suddenly, everything worked perfectly. I wish I'd done that a week ago.</p>
                    <p>Ironically, in finally fixing these items, I broke others. The various tweaks and compromises I'd made to try and 'fix' my layout, which wasn't looking the way I thought it should despite my formatting, were suddenly creating a mess because they had been compensating for elements that weren't functioning properly. As I write this, I'm attempting to clean some of it up, but I apologize if the page is messy.</p>

                    <h4>Week 4</h4>
                    <p>-Completed several React tutorials/read up on documentation, particularly <a href="https://reactjs.org/tutorial/tutorial.html">React's Tic-Tac-Toe</a>.</p>
                    <p>-Note: Also read and practiced basic Hooks, not included in original tutorial.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>-Attempted to build a React Battleship game. Successfully completed an interactive two-board layout with restricted clicking based on player, drawing basic structure and guidance from a <a href="https://medium.com/@shifrb/how-to-build-tic-tac-toe-with-react-hooks-ca37f6040022">variant</a> of the Tic-Tac-Toe tutorial, but using Hooks.</p>
                    <p>-Ultimately was unable to finish the build, with ships proving difficult to implement. With a little more time I'm confident I could have completed it, but up against the deadline I had a partially-built app with no discernable function. Much of original documentation for ships (interfaces, etc) is still present for evidence.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>-Refactored the Battleship app into a simple etch-a-sketch style game, with an "AI" (highly artificial, not very intelligent) matching each click with a Jackson Pollock impression on its own board.</p>
                    <p>-Note: I'm disappointed in this outcome, but I ultimately feel it was better to deploy an app with some function instead of a broken mess. As above, pieces of the original should still be accessible.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>-Deployed etch-a-sketch app and updated main page to point to it, and removed deprecated blackjack page.</p>

                    <h3>Final thoughts</h3>
                    <p>--As I mentioned above, I am disappointed with not putting forth my intended product. I feel the project was manageable, but I both found myself very short on time going into this week, and encountered some unexpected hiccups with deployment that caused me to stumble. The etch-a-sketch isn't what I'd hoped for, but I do think it's a small, fun app that still demonstrates a degree of familiarity with the material. Even with the challenges, I feel I've learned more in this past month than in almost any other class I've taken, and despite verything that is exciting. Unfortunately I can't be proud of this portfolio, but I learned as much from my mistakes as my successes. I hope it will be a solid foundation for work I can be more proud of in the future.</p>
