                    <ul>
                        <li>Finish <a href="https://www.codecademy.com/learn/introduction-to-javascript">Codecademy's CSS tutorial</a>, and learn Bootstrap and/or React</li>
                        <li>Build an actual webpage with at least basic functionality. Ambitiously, a simple game. Ideally this will incorporate some or all elements of the tools I've learned.</li>
                        <li>Entirely convert README.md to index.html for ease of use. <strong>{Update: Completed this 09/09/2021</strong></li>
                        <li>Review a Git tutorial. I haven't had any major issues, but I'm not quite as comfortable with it as I'd like.</li>
                        <li>In general: I want to transition from mostly theoretical understanding to concrete work and experience.</li>
                    </ul>

                <h4>Milestone 2</h4>
                <article>
                    <h4>My plans for next week:</h4>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Begin learning React - I've seen multiple resources shared, so I can't pinpoint which I'll start with, but I feel this is a key feature to get comfortable with next. Given its clear complexity and scope, I don't expect to have mastered it in any capacity by next week, but I want at least basic familiarity sooner than later.</li>
                        <li>Complete a Typescript tutorial, likely <a href="https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-typescript">Codecademy's</a>.</li>
                        <li>As a note on the above, I've mostly relied on Codecademy for my basic introduction, then branched out to other resources when I begin implementing. I generally like Codecademy because its format lets me quickly jump in to learning-by-doing, without needing to set much up. But for at least React, I'd like to break that pattern, just to keep my experience varied.</li>
                        <li>Blackjack: For next week, I want to get the underlying Javascript for the game more or less hammered out, even if it's not implemented as an interactable game on the page. I think I was too ambitious originally, so I want to break the plan into more specific chunks, and worry about the visual component later.</li>
                        <li>Set up Changelog and TODO with collapsible sections for each Milestone. If possible, also make Changelog's individual sections (Added, Changed, Notes) collapsible as well.</li>
                        <li>Style and Layout: Aesthetics aren't my strongest suit, but I want to spend some time sketching (maybe literally) my website's design, and thinking over its general styling and 'vibe'. This week I felt confident in my CSS and Bootstrap fundamentals, but without a plan it ended up feeling chaotic and unstructured.</li>
                        <li>Layout, continued: I also, badly, need to revisit my core HTML code and structure. What seemed reasonable even a week ago now drives me crazy, especially with the addition of CSS and Bootstrap to my repetoire.</li>
                        <li>General plan: I'm going to focus on specific, bite-sized pieces of projects to avoid getting lost or bogged down. The same will go for tutorials, especially React - if I begin lagging, I want to force myself to pivot toward something I can make progress on instead.</li>

                <h4>Milestone 3</h4>
                <article>
                    <h4>My plans for next week:</h4>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Finish learning React, currently I am not entirely up to speed with it.</li>
                        <li>Work on integrating javascript with html - so far I've had trouble getting scripts (imported or internal) to reliably affect pages. High priority.</li>
                        <li>Build something to demonstrate Typescript skill. I had meant to build a very basic Tic-Tac-Toe game, but because of the above issue with scripts I held off.</li>
                        <li>Fix main page layout now that Bootstrap is working as intended (and use some React to help, if possible), bring associated pages a bit more up to par.</li>
                        <li>Last week, I stated that I planned ot focus on smaller projects and avoid getting caught up in large ones. I failed to follow through on this, and instead spent much of this week figuratively bashing my head against a wall. Going forward, I am re-committing to that idea, even if it means dropping projects that are not working.</li>
                        <li>Lastly - seek help! So far I've mostly worked through the challenges alone, but I want to make an effort to go TA office hours to ask when an issue is stumping me. My difficulty with scripts is a good place to start.</li>
