                    <h4>My plans for next week:</h4>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Finish <a href="https://www.codecademy.com/learn/introduction-to-javascript">Codecademy's CSS tutorial</a>, and learn Bootstrap and/or React</li>
                        <li>Build an actual webpage with at least basic functionality. Ambitiously, a simple game. Ideally this will incorporate some or all elements of the tools I've learned.</li>
                        <li>Entirely convert README.md to index.html for ease of use.</li>
                        <li>Review a Git tutorial. I haven't had any major issues, but I'm not quite as comfortable with it as I'd like.</li>
                        <li>In general: I want to transition from mostly theoretical understanding to concrete work and experience.</li>
                    </ul>
